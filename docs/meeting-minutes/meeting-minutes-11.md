**Objective:**
Discuss alternatives for MatRiCT+.

**Agenda:**

- Review MatRiCT+.
- Propose new alternatives to be used.

**Summary:**

- MatRiCT+ is difficult to understand and implement.
- It is difficult to debug since it uses low level languages, and it is out of our expertise.
- It contains lots of hardware and kernel specific optimization since its original purpose is for benchmarking.
- Team concluded that it will be better to use another library.
- Baraq proposed for us to use lirisi library instead.
- Lirisi is easier to understand, and Baraq has already managed to implement it with a small-scale project.
- Team agreed with the change.
- Team will no longer try to achieve post-quantum goals.
